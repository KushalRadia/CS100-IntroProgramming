Slides for this week: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xa23s8LZ1UuMyu-daR_NOTcZbAOvmW6z49JlDzvuDNY/edit?slide=id.g37392b3eb5f_0_0#slide=id.g37392b3eb5f_0_0


In the help class, I have told students that there will following types of questions in the midterm exam.


a. Some algorithm/flowchart/code will be given and we will ask for the error in it? Or what will be the output

b. We may leave some part of the code/algorithm as a fill in the blanks question for you

c. In coding questions, we will ask you to write the algorithm/pseudocode/python code. If you can't write python code or don't remember the syntax, you can write the algorithm in your own words.


#FAQ

a. How much syntax should I know? I have added the important syntax in Week 5 slides from the cheat sheet. That would be enough for the midterm exam.

b. Can we use built-in functions such as % operator, length, in etc. Yes, we can use. In general, if this is an in-built function we haven't covered in class, I will give it as a hint in the exam question

c. Will there be any MCQ? No MCQ, no negative marking in any question


Conclusion: The midterm exam will test logic, understanding of code/algorithm, problem solving skills ....
