# CS100-IntroProgramming
Introduction to Problem Solving with Computers Using Python Programming

This course will introduce you to problem-solving using programming. Beginning with simple tasks like evaluating mathematical expressions, calculating income-tax, to solving JEE problems (maths, physics, chemistry), we will gradually move on to engineering problems from all branches of engineering (mechanical, electrical, mechatronics, computer). We will focus on building logic, learning design patterns such as modularity, establishing program correctness, debugging, testing, and efficiency.

* Rule 1: You must not look at solutions that are not your own.
* Rule 2: You must not share your solutions with other students.
* Rule 3: You must indicate on your submission any assistance you received.
* Rule 4: Don't ask an LLM/Google/ChatGpt/Gemini etc. to solve homework for you. Generating code from VScode/IDE is not allowed
* Please be aware: all submissions are subject to automated plagiarism detection
* Discuss ideas together, but do the coding on your own...
__Perhaps the only way you may fail this course is by engaging in dishonesty__
