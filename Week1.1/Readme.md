**Welcome to Week 1.1 (Aug 4-9)**

We will be spending some more time on Scratch and Flowcharts to get all students on the same page. 
I would like to share a nice tool with you for learning programming: http://flowgorithm.org/index.html


With this, we can make flowcharts, execute them, convert to various programming languages. 
We can also make graphics.

**BONUS QUESTIONS**

In the afternoon tutorial session, the following problems were discussed. You all can try them on your own.

Q1. Printing the quotient and remainder when A is divided by B. You can use only addition, if/else, loops. Using MOD or % is not allowed.

Q2. [Hard] Printing the first 10 pythagorean triplets where A^2 + B^2 = C^2     ( ^ stands for exponentiation)

Q3. Printing the first 10 pairs of numbers that satisfy A^2 = B^3

Q4. GCD/HCF of two numbers A and B. You can use only addition/subtraction, if/else, and loops. Using MOD or % is not allowed.

**EXTRA PRACTICE PROBLEMS**
E1. [Easy] Check is a given year is a leap year.
E2. [Easy] Check if a date entered in the format DDMMYY is a valid date.
E3. [Easy] If A and B are inputs, calculate A^B (A raised to power B), without the power function. You may use multiplication, addition.
E4. [Easy] Print the multiples of A that are smaller than the number B.
E5. [Easy] Simplify a fraction of the form N/D to its simplest form.

M1.[Medium] Calculate the value of e^x using Taylor series expansion.
M2. [Factorial] Calculate the value of Factorial N.
M3. [Medium] Given an integer (in decimal notation), reverse its digits. For example if the input is 754, the output should be 457.
M4. [Medium] Compute the sum of first N terms of an arithmetic progression of the form: a, a+b, a+ 2b, a+3b ...
M5. [Medium] Compute the sum of first N terms of a geometric progression of the form: a, a*r, a*r*r, a*r*r*r ...
M6. [Medium] Count the numbers from 1 to 100, that do not contain the digit 3.

H1. [Hard] Check if a point P (x,y) is inside a triangle defined by 3 Points: A (a1,a2) ; B (b1, b2); C (c1,c2)
H2. [Hard] Determine if a line is a tangent, secant or external to a circle.
H3. [Hard] Print all the permutations of first N digits.
H4. [Hard] Print all the combinations of first N digits.
H5. [Hard] Compute the Frobenius number, given two coin denominations A and B. It is the largest number that can't be obtained by using any amount of As and Bs. For example, if A is 3 and B is 5, the Frobenius number is 7. 


We also discussed various computer science concepts and general topics.
