**Welcome to Week 1.1 (Aug 4-9)**

We will be spending some more time on Scratch and Flowcharts to get all students on the same page. 
I would like to share a nice tool with you for learning programming: http://flowgorithm.org/index.html


With this, we can make flowcharts, execute them, convert to various programming languages. 
We can also make graphics.
