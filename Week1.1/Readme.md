**Welcome to Week 1.1 (Aug 4-9)**

We will be spending some more time on Scratch and Flowcharts to get all students on the same page. 
I would like to share a nice tool with you for learning programming: http://flowgorithm.org/index.html


With this, we can make flowcharts, execute them, convert to various programming languages. 
We can also make graphics.

**BONUS QUESTIONS**

In the afternoon tutorial session, the following problems were discussed. You all can try them on your own.

Q1. Printing the quotient and remainder when A is divided by B. You can use only addition, if/else, loops. Using MOD or % is not allowed.

Q2. [Hard] Printing the first 10 pythagorean triplets where A^2 + B^2 = C^2     ( ^ stands for exponentiation)

Q3. Printing the first 10 pairs of numbers that satisfy A^2 = B^3

Q4. GCD/HCF of two numbers A and B. You can use only addition/subtraction, if/else, and loops. Using MOD or % is not allowed.

We also discussed various computer science concepts and general topics.
